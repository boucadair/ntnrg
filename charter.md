# Non-Terrestrial Networking Research Group (NTNRG)

The Non-Terrestrial Networking Research Group (NTNRG) is chartered to
research the architectural, protocol design, and operational implications
of networking among connectivity-challenged nodes, specifically: networking
among nodes with highly dynamic connectivity imposed by virtue of their
non-terrestrial deployment environment. This includes High Altitude Platforms
(HAPS), typically in the stratosphere, satellites in Low, Mid, and
Geosynchronous orbits (LEO, MEO, GEO), and platforms in other cislunar
trajectories.

Previous research work (DTNRG) focused on the delay and disruption tolerance
required to communicate effectively in extreme connectivity-challenged
scenarios (vis. RFC 4838). This this led to the creation of the DTNWG which
has standardized BPv7 and BPSec, which are ready for operational use.
Since that time, network nodes on aerospace platforms in the cislunar regime
have seen a rapid rise in deployment and scale. This regime poses less extreme
time constraints on connectivity, but the rapidity of change and variability
of topologies that might be built among nodes moving through this environment
present new challenges.

The intended work products of the NTNRG include evaluation of the impact to
inter-networking among NTN nodes imposed by these deployments as well as
possible mitigation of adverse effects. Of specific
interest are:

  * simulation, measurement, or testing techniques that are particularly
    well suited for NTNs,
  * analysis of any impact to transport protocols as paths experience normal
    changes in characteristics like latency, jitter, and loss associated with
    nominal platform behavior, and
  * investigations of the challenges and benefits of tuning existing
    transport and application protocols in emerging NTN architectures.

NTNRG may also consider the implications of and requirements for NTN nodes
from different administrative domains dynamically forming connectivity.
The control plane requirements and trust model design parameters are
especially relevant.

An explicit non-goal is to propose changes to existing IETF protocols.
The research group may explore ideas that require such changes, and is uniquely
placed to discuss their implications with the IETF community, but the potential
incorporation of such ideas into the standards process is a matter for the IETF
and is out of scope for this group.
